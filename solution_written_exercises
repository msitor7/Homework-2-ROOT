1.1. What is the difference between struct and class?

In a struct, all members (variables and functions) are public by default. This means that you can access the members of a struct without any restrictions.
In a class, all members are private by default. This means that you need to provide member functions (getters and setters) to access or modify the data members of a class.

1.3 Why do we need our class to be derived from the TObject?

Deriving your class from TObject in ROOT is necessary to take full advantage of ROOT's features and to ensure your classes are compatible with the ROOT framework, including I/O, RTTI, object management, and integration with ROOT tools and utilities.
